## ‚ÅâÔ∏è About
**A Submission to the 2024 Young Inventors Challenge of ASTI Malaysia**, the **Koral Rangers** application allows anyone to easily detect coral bleaching using pictures of corals.
- **Have past experiences with corals?** Load images from device storage and check their health!
- **Want to check nearby corals?** Open your camera and snap a photo!
- **Want to learn a little something?** Open the about page to learn more about bleaching and the project!

As corals continuously receive increased risk from the global increase of temperatures, the time is now to act. We Koral Rangers must take this stand now!


## üî® Builds & Installations
You may head to our **[Releases Page](https://github.com/GGGalang/KoralRangers/releases)** to install the latest version of the application.

For fellow AI enthusiasts willing to **try their own model** or **people wanting to build their own APKs**, follow the steps below:
1. **Download the Repository.** You may download it as a .ZIP file or clone it locally using Git/GitHub Desktop.
2. **Place your own AI Model.** Locate ```app/src/main/ml/``` in the cloned folder and upload your own **TFLITE** AI Model in there named **model.tflite**
   - It is important that the model is named **model.tflite** unless you are capable of changing the raw application files to accommodate different filenames.
   - It is also as important to use **TFLITE** AI Models, as the code only supports this. For more information, visit **[this](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/models/convert_tf)** website to learn more about TFLite AI Model conversions! You may also download **[our 95% Accurate model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1do-eYXFRqS7pzwgHCiVvERrCsht3fbVa/view?usp=drive_link)** for use and experimentation!
3. **Build & Run!** Android Studio should automatically launch the application on your chosen device. If you don't have one, the APK file is located at ```app/release/KoralRangers.apk```!


## üå∏ Dedications & Declarations
The team would also like to appreciate **Ma'am Marizel Villanueva** for her support as team coach in this endeavor.

This project is **OPEN SOURCE** with the standard MIT License; feel free to **modify** for further innovations! While our part may be over, features such as alert systems and more may be implemented to improve the application for end users.
